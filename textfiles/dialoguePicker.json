Imagine if all us pickers make a stand!\n\n What separates us from ‘em so called reds? We all gotta feed our famblies, We all gotta live, we all jus’ tryna’ get by without hurtin’ nobody. We can’t jus’ sit here while our kind suffers an’ endures for our sakes! With ‘em cops around, we’ll never get peace.\n\n If we… If we unite and support each other though… we can WIN! We’d be the ones in control. We can feed our famblies an’ share our meat! Nobody gotta suffer no more!"}
